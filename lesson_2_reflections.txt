When I initialized a repository it created a hidden file named .git. 

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?

Answer: Working directory is the file which I study on and save the files I study on. 
By commiting git (git init) them we are creating a repository which is able to upload to git iste
felan filan.
Staging area is using for adding some files on existing file. I mean that you do not need to 
add extra file on existing file one by one. Istedigin kadar ekle (git add) 
sonra tek bir comment ile repository
de eklersin. kapis?

In order to commit, if u want first check the changes (git status). (by doing this, you will see that which file
have been changed.) If you do not remember what the changes inside the files, do not worry, you check it by doing 
"git diff". Then, I think you should (or u can, not sure) add the changed file in the repository (git add [file name]). 
In order to add a commit on my computer, first you should configure you name and email by doing 
$ git config user.name "Ali Said"
$ git config user.email "alisaid@hotmail.com"
then commit by
$ git commit -m "add delay back to bullets"

branch ekleme:

first doing "git branch" learn which branches we have. then by doing git branch "vermek istedigin branch name"
you can add a new branch. If you want to study with the new branch do "git checkout [branch name]".
farkli branch da calismak istedigin degisikligi, deneme yanilma yollarini rahatca yapabilmene olanak saglar.

In order to combine two branches use "git merge [branch name1] [branch name2]"

sometimes git does not merge the file. It wants you to check the file and and write the correct one. yani simdi 
orjinal dosya belli tamam mi. ayni adda iki dosya olusturuyon ikisi de birbirinden farkli dogal olarak uc dosya
elinde olmus oluyor ve ucu de birbirinden farkli. birseye karar ver diyor, adam ol lan diyor. :)
