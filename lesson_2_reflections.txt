When I initialized a repository it created a hidden file named .git. 

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?

Answer: Working directory is the file which I study on and save the files I study on. 
By commiting git (git init) them we are creating a repository which is able to upload to git iste
felan filan.
Staging area is using for adding some files on existing file. I mean that you do not need to 
add extra file on existing file one by one. Istedigin kadar ekle (git add) 
sonra tek bir comment ile repository
de eklersin. kapis?
